    "Rugged trail, lot of uneven ground with rocks and tree roots. But waterfall is absolutely worth the hike. ",
    "Very pretty! The last mile to the falls is pretty difficult but worth it. Take water & a snack, and wear hiking boots!",
    "rough going up, rocky and roots but the falls were awesome!",

    "Absolutely phenomenal Journey.",
    "Awesome trail. Very steep up at the top.",
    "spectacular with the snow. still a good amount on the last two miles. a bit slick. creek crossings were sketchy with ice covered rocks. highly recommend poles! couldn not have completed this hike today without them. ",
    "The first two miles are deceptively easy - wide roads and easy terrain. It was super muddy though. The third mile got snowy and more rocky terrain. Last mile was very snowy-icy and had a lot of fallen trees that made it super hard to pass and a difficult river crossing in the end. But it is absolutely worth it!",
